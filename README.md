# Bastors (BAS-to-RS)

Bastors is a toy transpiler, written in Python, that takes a TinyBasic dialect as input and generates Rust code. It is a toy, partly, because its primary objective is to make me more comfortable writing Python code. And partly because it makes no effort to generate any kind of idiomatic Rust code.



## How do I use it?

```
usage: bastors.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] input
```
### Example

Consider ```programs/fibonacci.bas```:

```
        LET A=0
        LET B=1
    100 PRINT A
        LET B=A+B
        LET A=B-A
        IF B<=1000 THEN GOTO 100
        END
```

This can be transpiled to Rust with this invocation:

```
$ ./bastors.py programs/fibonacci.bas 
struct State {
    a: i32,
    b: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut state: State = State {
        a: 0,
        b: 0,
    };
    state.a = 0;
    state.b = 1;
    loop {
        println!("{}", state.a);
        state.b = state.a + state.b;
        state.a = state.b - state.a;
        if state.b > 1000 {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Or it can be output to file, and later compiled using rustc:

```
$ ./bastors.py programs/fibonacci.bas -o fib.rs
$ rustc fib.rs
$ ./fib
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
89
144
233
377
610
```

## GOTO Elimination
It turns out that the lion share of this project was about how to deal with the GOTO statement.
Since Rust does not have any concept of GOTO and Basic relies quite heavily on it. I ended up following the GOTO elimination algorithms found at [DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/goto-elimination-algorithm).

This splits up the usage of GOTO into different cases and provides strategies to deal with them. You can read more about the algorithms at the link above or in comments in goto_elimimination.py.

It makes no attempt to create beautiful code. For instance, here is a game called *Hunt The hurkle* written by [Damian Walker](http://damian.cyningstan.org.uk/post/130/hunt-the-hurkle-another-tiny-basic-game):

## Help me make this Pythonic
A big reason for me to write this tool is to improve my Python. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Tell me what data structures I misused! Or which I should use instead! Tell me about best practices I missed, both in code and in how I set the project up!

Any and all code review would be very kind!

## Running tests
Bastors includes tests that aim to make development easier. It will test the lexing-, parsing-, GOTO elimination- and rustification phases. The tests can be run by running ```py.test tests```.

## TinyBasic Grammar
The grammar understood for this TinyBasic is as follows:
```
    line ::= number statement CR | statement CR
    statement ::= PRINT expr-list
                  IF expression operator expression THEN statement
                  GOTO number
                  INPUT var-list
                  LET var = expression
                  GOSUB number
                  RETURN
                  CLEAR
                  LIST
                  RUN
                  END
    expr-list ::= (string|expression) (, (string|expression) )*
    var-list ::= var (, var)*
    expression ::= term ((+|-) term)*
    term ::= factor ((*|/) factor)*
    factor ::= var | number | (expression)
    var ::= A | B | C ... | Y | Z
    number ::= digit digit*
    digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 8 | 9
    operator ::= < (>|=|ε) | > (<|=|ε) | =
    string ::= " (a|b|c ... |x|y|z|A|B|C ... |X|Y|Z|digit)* " """
```

## Contribute
If for any reason you find this neat and want to contribute, please feel free! A good way would be to find and add Basic programs you wish could be transpiled to the program/ directory. The test harness will make sure all programs found there will stay compile-able. If you find a program that does not transpile or compile, please file an issue and maybe it can be fixed!

Another way would be to make the Rust code better. To do away with the big State structure mayhaps? And instead only pass the variables needed? Or maybe make the TinyBasic language handle expressions as GOTO or GOSUB targets? Or making sure comments end up in nice places in the Rust code? Or adding RND() or other neat functions?

Maybe you want to convert some old graphics stuff? That uses PUT to draw pixels? And convert that into some Rust canvas thingies? Sounds cool.
